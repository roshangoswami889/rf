Hence, we should not ignore fitness, because if done so, we won’t be able to keep our minds strong and clear.An individual’s top priority should be to remain fit. This will ensure their health. And one such way of that is by maintaining fitness. Health is a state of complete mental, physical as well as social well-being. A fit individual can accomplish much more in life. They are immune to many diseases, don’t feel fatigued in day-to-day functions, and have a positive mindset to strive in life for good. Fitness doesn’t always mean lifting heavy weights, a balanced and disciplined diet also holds an important role in the same. Eating the right amount of food rich in proteins, and good fats such as omega-3, vitamins and minerals, etc is essential. 
        Maintaining a proper sleeping pattern is another important aspect of fitness. Getting enough sleep ensures proper functioning of the mind thus making us more productive. Eight hours of quality sleep can boost our immune system, lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and improve our overall health.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">"Enjoy the game and chase your dreams. Dreams do come true!"<br>
- Sachin Tendulkar <br>"The era of playing aggressive cricket and to have the mid-on up is gone. You now try to read the mindset of a batsman."<br>
- Mahendra Singh Dhoni <br> "No cricket team in the world depends on one or two players. The team always plays to win." <br>
- Virat Kohli <br>"My aim is to play Test matches. For me, there is a different feel of Test cricket as it tests your character. You come to know about your mental toughness, and most importantly, there is another level of satisfaction as a player."<br>
- Suresh Raina <br>"Cricket is the only sport in the world where you are absolutely horrible at something and you still need to go out and do it."<br>
- Harsha Bhogle <br> "The best way to be sucessful is to be fearless."<br>
- Mithali Raj <br> "A gun is no more dangerous than a cricket bat in the hands of a madman."<br>
- Prince Philip <br>"Unwanted honking not only irritates others, but may also end up causing accidents. Drivers lose cool and it may result in road rage."<br>
- Rahul Dravid <br>"Cricket is a game played by 11 fools and watched by 11,000 fools,"<br>
- George Bernard Shaw <br> "You have to accept the failure and success and you keep moving on. That's what I've done."<br>
- Rohit Sharma <br> "I no longer see myself as a woman cricketer. Why should there be labels when none are required?"<br>
- Smriti Mandhana <br>"Irrespective of whether you have talent or not, one has to work hard. Just being talented isn't anything; you can end up wasting it before you realize."<br>
- Virat Kohli <br>In international cricket, the core group in most of the teams would remain the same. So you know what's expected, but they will operate in different conditions, which is why the homework about conditions is the key.SportsPlus logo
